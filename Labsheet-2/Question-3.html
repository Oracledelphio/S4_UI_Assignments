    <h1>Understanding Web Development</h1>

    <h2>Introduction to HTML</h2>
    <p>
        <span class="highlight">HTML</span> (HyperText Markup Language) is the fundamental language of the web. 
        It structures content using elements like paragraphs, headings, and links. Every web page consists of 
        HTML, which defines how content is displayed. Without HTML, websites wouldn’t exist. It uses a system of 
        tags to mark different sections of content. Tags such as <span class="highlight">&lt;p&gt;</span> for 
        paragraphs and <span class="highlight">&lt;h1&gt;</span> for headings define elements on a page. Mastering 
        HTML is the first step in becoming a web developer. It works in conjunction with CSS and JavaScript to 
        create dynamic web experiences.
    </p>

    <h2>The Role of CSS</h2>
    <p>
        <span class="highlight">CSS</span> (Cascading Style Sheets) controls the visual presentation of web pages. 
        While HTML structures content, CSS enhances it by defining colors, layouts, and typography. CSS allows 
        developers to create aesthetically pleasing and responsive designs. There are three ways to apply CSS: 
        <span class="highlight">inline, internal, and external</span>. Using CSS, elements like backgrounds, margins, and text styles can be 
        customized. Without CSS, web pages would look plain and unstyled. It plays a crucial role in making the 
        web more engaging. Modern frameworks such as Bootstrap further simplify CSS styling and ensure a 
        consistent look across different devices.
    </p>

    <h2>Importance of JavaScript</h2>
    <p>
        <span class="highlight">JavaScript</span> is a powerful programming language used to make web pages 
        interactive. While HTML structures content and CSS styles it, JavaScript adds dynamic behavior. It enables 
        features like image sliders, pop-ups, and form validation. JavaScript interacts with the DOM to manipulate 
        elements dynamically. Popular libraries like <span class="highlight">React</span> and <span class="highlight">Vue.js</span> enhance JavaScript’s capabilities. Without 
        JavaScript, websites would be static and less engaging. As web development evolves, JavaScript remains a 
        crucial skill. Learning JavaScript opens opportunities for front-end and back-end development, making it an 
        essential tool in modern web technologies.
