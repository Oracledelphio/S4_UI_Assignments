## Question 1: HTML Form Attributes  
### **1.1 Purpose of `name` and `id` Attributes**  
- The `name` attribute is used to reference form data when submitting a form.  
- The `id` attribute uniquely identifies an element for styling or scripting.  

### **1.2 Websites that Work within `iframe`**  
Some websites allow embedding via `<iframe>`, such as:   
- Google Maps (`https://maps.google.com`)  
- Wikipedia (`https://www.wikipedia.org`)

## Question 2: CSS Grid Layout  
A modern **grid-based layout** was created to match the reference design. The grid dynamically adapts to screen sizes.  

### **Implementation**  
- Used `display: grid` with `grid-template-rows` & `grid-template-columns`.  
- Ensured full-page coverage with flexible grid dimensions.  
- Styled using **external CSS** for a clean, modern UI.

## Question 3: Responsive Images  
Implemented responsive images using `@media` queries in **CSS** to ensure proper resizing when the viewport width changes.  

### **Solution Highlights**  
- Used `max-width: 100%` and `height: auto` for fluid scaling.  
- Applied media queries to adjust image display at different breakpoints.  
- Ensured all three images remain visible across all screen sizes.

- **Main Content:** Provides a detailed description of the club.  
- **"Organized By" Section:** Displays information about the club's organizers.  

### **4.2 Smooth Scrolling & Internal Links**  
- Implemented anchor links (`<a href="#section-id">`) for smooth navigation.  
- Used `scroll-behavior: smooth;` in CSS for better user experience.  

### **4.3 Final Implementation**
