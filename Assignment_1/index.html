            <p><strong>Subject:</strong> Application for Masterâ€™s in Computer Science</p>

            <p>Dear Admissions Committee,</p>
            
            <p>I am writing to express my keen interest in pursuing a Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. With a strong academic background in Artificial Intelligence and a passion for innovative research, I aspire to contribute meaningfully to the field of advanced computing.</p>

            <p>During my undergraduate studies in AI and Data Science, I worked on multiple projects related to deep learning, cybersecurity, and blockchain integration. My research on adaptive robotic manipulator control algorithms using ROS and Gazebo has been a cornerstone of my academic journey. Additionally, my experience in web development, full-stack programming, and generative AI has provided me with a well-rounded technical foundation.</p>

            <p>I am particularly excited about MITâ€™s emphasis on cutting-edge AI research and interdisciplinary collaboration. I believe my skills align well with MITâ€™s rigorous curriculum and research-driven environment. With a deep commitment to innovation and problem-solving, I am eager to contribute to MITâ€™s thriving academic community.</p>

            <p>Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to further discuss how my background and aspirations align with MITâ€™s mission.</p>

            <p>Sincerely, <br> <strong>Kurt Sony</strong></p>
